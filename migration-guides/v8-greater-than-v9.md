* If it's not already the case you must now use the [`copy-keycloak-resources-to-public` postinstall script](https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify-starter/blob/92b20fe74154ef8cf037f4b156eb3b2e5264a074/package.json#L11).
* The `keycloakVersionDefaultAssets` has been removed in favor of [`loginThemeResourcesFromKeycloakVersion`](../build-options.md#loginthemeresourcesfromkeycloakversion). &#x20;
* You now must have `mvn` (Maven, `brew install maven`) installed to build your Keycloakify theme. The `bundler` build option has been removed in favor of [doCreateJar](../build-options.md#docreatejar).  (Note that Maven is present by default on the GitHub Action runners). &#x20;
* The `extraThemeNames` build option has been removed, if you have theme variant, simply pass an array to the [themeName option](../build-options.md#themename).
* If you implement an account theme. In Keycloak version prior to 21 and down you must select [`<your theme name>_retrocompat`](https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify/assets/6702424/33c177cc-7efc-466a-8570-5cda4ab6410d) in the dropdown to select your theme. If you know your theme will only be used in Keycloak 23 and up you can set the [`doBuildRetrocompatAccountTheme`](../build-options.md#dobuildretrocompataccounttheme) to `false`. (Note that tere is one version of Keycloak with wich account theme generated by Keycloakify won't work, it's Keycloak 22, all other version are supported).\

# CSS Level Customization

Keycloakify enables you to customize the pages without changing the React component by using CSS, SASS LESS Tailwind or a [CSS in JS solution](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

If you can make it work, CSS Level Customization is preferable over component level customization since it's much easier to maintain.

If you want to use a component library like MUI, ShadeCN/UI or Antlr, this is not the approach that you should favor you should instead checkout [Component Level customization](../component-level-customization/).

{% content-ref url="basic-example.md" %}
[basic-example.md](basic-example.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

[^1]: Example: Emotion or tss-react.

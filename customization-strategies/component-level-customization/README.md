# Component Level Customization

The Keycloakify starter repository may initially seem sparse in terms of React components, which might be confusing. However, there's no need to worryâ€”this design choice will soon make sense.

By default, Keycloakify internalizes all the React components that make up the default theme, exposing only the `<DefaultPage />` component.

If you want to customize any component from the default theme, you can easily do so by running the following command:

```bash
npx keycloakify eject-page
```

This command allows you to select specific components from Keycloakify's source code, which will then be copied into your own codebase for further customization.

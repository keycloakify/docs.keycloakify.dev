# ðŸ˜ž Can't identify the page to customize?

If you can't seem to find the page that you're looking for in [the reference Storybook](https://storybook.keycloakify.dev/?path=/story/introduction--page), first thing to try is to open the devlopper tool and see the page id of the page you're trying to customize.  \

First one is there is no KcContext

Other scenario you get a page that is not listed in [the reference storybook](https://storybook.keycloakify.dev/?path=/story/introduction--page).

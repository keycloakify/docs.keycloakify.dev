# ðŸ›‘ Errors Keycloak in Logs

If you ever encounter one of these errors:

```log
FTL stack trace ("~" means nesting-related):
        - Failed at: #local value = object[key]  [in template "login.ftl" in macro "ftl_object_to_js_code_declaring_an_object" at line 70, column 21]

**It's just noise**, they can be safely ignored.\
You can, however, and are encouraged to, report any that you would spot.\
Just [open an issue about it](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/issues/new) and I will release a patched version of Keycloakify in the better delays.

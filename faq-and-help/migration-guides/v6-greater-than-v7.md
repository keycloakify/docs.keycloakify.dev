# ⬆️ v6 -> v7

Many things have changed, I invite you to have a look at the latest version of the starter to see what's up:

The main takeaway is that, now your theme source files should be located in a keycloak-theme directory somewhere in your src directory OR at the root of your directory.

Acceptable directory structure:

```
src/
  keycloak-theme/
    login/
    account/
    email/

===OR===

src/
  foo/
    bar/
      keycloak-theme/
        login/
        account/
        email/

===OR===

src/
  login/
  account/
  email/
```

You don't need to have all three variant of the theme. If you only need the login theme for example you can have only the `login` directory.\
\
If you had a`keycloak_email_theme` at the root of your project it must be move alongside the `login/` and `account/` directory.
